To implement tests using the "Wrap Methods/Class" technique, you can follow a structured approach that involves creating a wrapper around the class or method you want to test. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with legacy code or when you need to add testing capabilities to a class that wasn't designed with testability in mind. Below, I'll provide a detailed example using Dart, which demonstrates how to use the "Wrap Class" technique to facilitate unit testing.

### Example: Testing a Geolocator Class

Suppose you have a class that uses the geolocation services of a device. Directly testing this class can be challenging due to its dependency on device-specific APIs and external services. By wrapping the class, you can control its behavior in a test environment.

#### Step 1: Define the Original Class

Here's a simple implementation of a class that uses geolocation:

```dart
import 'package:geolocator/geolocator.dart';

class GeoLocatorService {
  Future<Position?> getCurrentPosition() async {
    return await Geolocator.getCurrentPosition(desiredAccuracy: LocationAccuracy.high);
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Wrapper Interface

Define an interface that abstracts the functionality of the `GeoLocatorService`. This interface will be used by both the real service and the mock service.

```dart
abstract class IGeoLocatorService {
  Future<Position?> getCurrentPosition();
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Wrapper Class

Modify the original `GeoLocatorService` to implement the new interface:

```dart
class GeoLocatorService implements IGeoLocatorService {
  @override
  Future<Position?> getCurrentPosition() async {
    return await Geolocator.getCurrentPosition(desiredAccuracy: LocationAccuracy.high);
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create a Mock Implementation

Create a mock implementation of `IGeoLocatorService` for testing purposes:

```dart
class MockGeoLocatorService implements IGeoLocatorService {
  @override
  Future<Position?> getCurrentPosition() async {
    // Return a fixed position for testing
    return Position(latitude: 0.0, longitude: 0.0, timestamp: DateTime.now(), accuracy: 100.0, altitude: 0.0, heading: 0.0, speed: 0.0, speedAccuracy: 0.0);
  }
}
```

#### Step 5: Write Unit Tests

Now, you can write unit tests using the mock implementation:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  test('Test getCurrentPosition returns fixed position', () async {
    IGeoLocatorService geoLocatorService = MockGeoLocatorService();
    var position = await geoLocatorService.getCurrentPosition();

    expect(position!.latitude, 0.0);
    expect(position.longitude, 0.0);
  });
}
```

### Conclusion

By wrapping the `GeoLocatorService` with an interface (`IGeoLocatorService`), we decouple the implementation details from the usage, allowing us to inject a mock implementation during testing. This approach enhances testability and allows for more controlled and predictable testing outcomes.
